I am a senior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Queensland, affiliated with the <i>Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science</i> (CBCS), and the <i>Centre for Marine Science</i> (CMS). Mathematical tools unify my research across several diverse topics in theoretical ecology, biodiversity conservation, and natural resource management. I am especially interested in how we sustain, and improve the well-being of, human populations at least cost to biodiversity.

I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Stephen Ellner, where I used dynamical systems, optimal control, and statistical theory to recommend policies to improve the management of invasive species, agricultural pests, and fisheries.
